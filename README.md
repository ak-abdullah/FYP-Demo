## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user opens the PhysioGo app and starts a guided exercise.
2. The device camera captures the user's movements.
3. Frames are sent to a Python backend for real-time pose estimation.
4. The app receives posture feedback and progress data.
5. Visual feedback is displayed to help the user correct form.
